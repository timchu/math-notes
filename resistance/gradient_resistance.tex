What is the gradient of Effective Resistance between two vertices with
respect
to a single edge's resistance? This is part of the "Is Effective Resistance a
Hyper-metric" problem.

Using the "min-energy-flow" formulation of Effective Resistance, I show
that the gradient is equal to the square of the flow on that edge.

\section{Why?}
Let the flow on an edge be $f$ in any min energy flow with boudnary
constraints. Suppose the resistance of that edge is lowered by $\eps$.

The min-energy flow must decrease by at least $\epsilon \cdot f^2$.
If you raised the resistance of that edge by $\eps$, the min-energy flow
must increase by at most $\epsilon \cdot f^2$. This is because those two
values are the change in flow-energy assuming the underlying
flow-with-boundary-conditions doesn't change.

Since the partial of Effective Resistance with respect to a single edge
is continuous (no proof!), we conclude it must be exactly $f^2$
(questionable claim!)

\section{Extensions?}
I Believe the above claim holds for $q$-flow-energy-minizers, where this
is defined to be th minimum energy flow from point $A$ to point $B$
where energy is calculated by taking $f^q$.
