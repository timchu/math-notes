A short probability puzzle:

Suppose you have two bags, A and B. There is a probability
distribution over A and B, on where one of $n$ toys should go. Let the
toy go in bag $A$ with probability $a$, and bag $B$ with probability
$b$.

The objective is: if only $t$ toys are placed in all bags, then bucket $B$ should
concentrate around $\eps$ of what you'd expect.  That is, for
some error threshold $\eps$, bag $B$ should contain $b(1\pm\eps)$
percentage of the toys.

What should the number of toys $t$ be, in terms
of $a, b, \eps$? If you fix $t$, what should the probabilities $a, b$ be
to ensure $\eps$ concentration in bag $B$?

\subsection{Notes}
Here, if $a = b = \frac{1}{2}$, then the number of toys $t$ should be
approximately $\eps^{-2}$ (unproven).

Suppose $t = \eps^{-1}$. Then what should $b$ be?


\section{Relation to Sampling, and obtaining Effective Resistance in
$O(\eps^{-1})$ time.}
Suppose you have a given vertex $v$, and a cut with two parts: $A$ and
$B$.  Let $v$ be in part $A$, and let it have $a'$ neighbors in $A$ and
$b'$ neighbors in $B$.

Here, we model degree-preservation on $v$ as placing down $a'+b'$ edges,
either in $A$ or in $B$.

Now, if we do leverage score sampling and sample $E$ edges, the probability any edge appears
is equal to the (leverage-score)$*|E|/n$.  If we set $E = n/\eps$, then
it becomes $(leverage-score)*\eps^{-1}$.

For any vertex of a unit graph, any edge leading into it has leverage
score at least $\frac{1}{d}$, and thus for each vertex the sum of
leverage scores is at least $1$. Therefore, the expected
number of edges is at least $\frac{1}{\eps}$. 

Assuming the worst case, the number of edges is equal to
$\frac{1}{\eps}$.
