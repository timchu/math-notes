Sample bicliques.

The overarching idea is to break $K_B$ up into a collection of bicliques, each
bucketed by the min-degree vertex.

The maximally suspicious thing to me right now is that we are .

1. Thresh out low degree vertices. There aren't too many of these, assuming
integer poly weighted graphs. (This step not super necessary. You can make this
    work for low degree vertices.).

2. For higher weight vertices, bucket them by min degree of edge.
3. (This magically induces not-that-many-more-cliques).
4. Magically make them balanced.
5. On each balanced biclique, sample the appropriate amount. (Do this on varing
    buckets of $r$).

If: we have a group of bicliques, each of which are bucketed by min degree, each
of which are bucketed by $r$

1. Compute the weightd degrees of $K_B$.
