Checking whether a distance in in ER: do a negative mean-centered-pivot,
take the pseudoinv, and determine if the result is a Laplacian.

Notes: Sparsifying $L_1$ can be done via cut matrices.

Can one get a class of matrices, or metrics, via $M$ matrices? What are
$M$ matrices?o

What kind of metrics does one get from pseudoinverse of the SDD
matrices?

Gomory-Hu trees, and $l_2$ distance along trees, and all of that, appear
to be within ER. It remains an open question whether square roots of ERs
are in ER (note that experiments show no, but on n = 30 size graphs, and
with some numerical error).
