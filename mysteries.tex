\item How do you solve directed flow?
\item $l_k$ distance on a tree, is embeddable in Effective Resistance.
\item Let $C$ be the covariance matrix of any distance in 
\[ \{l_2, l_1, l_2^2, Effective-Resistance\}. \]

$C^k$ for $k < 1$ is a covariance matrix of the same distance.
Why?  (Here, Covariance = mean-center the points in $l_2^2$, then
    take dot products.)
\item Why does Matrix Chernoff for $L_G^\dag$ give such terrible
concentration for each effective resistance?
\item Can graphical spectral sketches preserve all pairs max flow?
\item Can graphical spectral sketches / spectral sparsifiers, preserve
$q$-norm flow?
\end{enumerate}
