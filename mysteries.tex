\begin{enumerate}
\item How do you solve directed flow?
\item $l_k$ distance on a tree, is embeddable in Effective Resistance.
\item $L_1^{1/2}$ is in $L_1$, where $L_1$ is the sum of cut
matrices. The same is true for Euclidean distances!!!
\item Why does Matrix Chernoff for $L_G^\dag$ give such terrible
concentration for each effective resistance?
\item Can graphical spectral sketches preserve all pairs max flow?
\item Can graphical spectral sketches / spectral sparsifiers, preserve
$q$-norm flow?
\end{enumerate}
