\section{Experiments}

In this section, we build graphs and calculate the most central
vertex. We provide copious visualizations and more.

We also build $k$-NN graphs from data, and calculate how fast
heat flows on these graphs. Note that it is unclear how I want to
set the vertex weights on these $k$-NN graphs.
