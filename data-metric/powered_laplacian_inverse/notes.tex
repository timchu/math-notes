Note; Fiedler only works when you take $e_2$ (eigenvector for
    $\lambda_2$ of $L$) and take all
items with eigenvalue either $ \geq 0$ or $ \leq 0$, or $\geq -1$
and $\leq 1$. It doesn't work otherwise.

Note: If you try $L^{2\dag}$ on a dumbell graph, the inner
product with respect to this is HUGE.
