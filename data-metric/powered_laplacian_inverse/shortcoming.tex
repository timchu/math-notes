\section{Shortcomings}
I attempted to determine whether the vertices $i$ where:
$\chi_{i}^T \left(L^{\dag}\right)^k\chi_{ab}$ is $ \geq 0$, are connected. The
motivation is that when $q=1$ its connected (voltage threshold
cut), and when $q = \infty$ it's connected (Fiedler nodal
domain).

Turns out it's not. Take a star with edge weights $1$ except one
edge with weight $3$. Then choose vertex $a$ and $b$ to be the center
and the vertex with an edge of weight $3$ respectively. This will break
connectivity.
Maybe figuring out the proof for Fiedler's nodal domains will be
helpful.
