Suppose you have a point in a grid, that gets finer and finer.
This is the fundamental operation: bisecting a quad (rather than
    bisecting a line, as in effective resistance).

The idea is: bisecting every quad should behave nicely with this
measure.

\section{Examples}
I think $p$-resistance works ok, for $p < 1 + \frac{1}{d-1}$.
