\section{Construction}
We construct a symmetric measure $S$ such that
\[S(a, x) > S(b, x) \Leftrightarrow H(a,x) > H(b, x). \]
Recall $H(a, x)$ is equal to:
\[ \left(\chi_{a}-\chi_x\right)^T L^\dag (2m \chi_x -
    \overline{d}). \]

Given fixed $x$, the ordering of $H(a,x)$ is the same as the
ordering of:
\[ (\chi_{a})^T L^\dag (2m \chi_x -
    \overline{d}) \]
or
\[ (2m \chi_{a} - \overline{d})^T L^\dag (2m \chi_x -
    \overline{d}) \]
where the only difference between the final equation and the
initial one is the addition of constants. This is now a symmetric
measure.
