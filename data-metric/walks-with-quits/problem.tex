\section{Problem with this Approach}
The problem with this approach: I think random walks with quits
has behavior governed more or less by geodesic distance. This is
since probability of quitting is exponential in path length.

Alsoo this doesn't work well with a finer and finer grid.
Somehow, the finer and finer grid seems to have odd behavior that
a regular grid does not have.
