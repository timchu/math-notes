To find distance between $s$ and $t$: rather than have flow all
come out of $s$, we allow
flows to come out of a suite of vertices, where there's some
penalty for having the flow come out of a vertex that isn't $s$.
Likewise, flows can have sinks at vertices that aren't $t$, at
some cost.

If we use effective resistance as our metric hereafter, this
should be some kind of QCQP. Minimizing some electrical flow
satisfying some demands, plus the penalty for those demands. I
don't actually know if this is a QCQP but it feels like it could
be.
