Heat half lives have the property that they are connected. In
this note, we quickly determine whether they satisfy Rayleigh.

Graph: Take the line times 100, and take a clique and a single
edge from the middle of the line to that clique. Picture
attached. The dotted line is the edge that we will attach.
