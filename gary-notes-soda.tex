Edge squared: What is th continuous gaussian kernel? (Gauss Kernel is
    like edge squared).

Trees: Can you go from Trees back up to MSS? Is it just as hard? Or can
you sidestep it?
Random spanning trees; Nick Harvey gives a simple example where random
spanning trees fail. Reference that. Question: Are we generating a
single tree? Independently sampled?
