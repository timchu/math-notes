\section{Things that are blocking me from writing further}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I haven't distilled down a core idea that can be expressed
simply.
\item I don't have a good hold on what my potential function,
  even for $q=2$, is. In terms of barycentric coordinates, which
  is almost certianly what I want to use (since it must be
      guaranteed that the potential function on each 'face' of my
      Voronoi subdivision must be supported on the vertices of
      these faces).
\item I don't have a good picture
\item I don't have a good reason to say \textit{why} flow is an
interesting idea at all, other than it seemed to work
interestingly for $q=2$ (for reasons that seem to be geonmetric:
Euclidean distance squared is a very nice function).
\end{enumerate}
